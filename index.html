          Have you ever heard about cryptocurrency? Or maybe something called NFT that used to take over the world with 
          it innovative idea? Well, all of those ideas are inventions based on a new technology called blockchain. The idea
          behind it is to guaranteed ownership of a person's assets on the network, making it the most secure method to protect
          your assets online.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what does it have to do with Solidity? Well, Solidity is a programming language design mainly for the purpose of 
          creating "Smart Contracts" for blockchain application. It allows us to control how we want to implement blockchain in
          our app to interact with users. But aren't that normal programming language like C++, Java, Python can also do that?
          And also, what are those "blockchain" and "Smart Contracts" were you talking about? Don't worry my friends, because 
          all of it will be explain right below.
        </p>
        <div class="topic-header">
          <h3>So first thing first, What is blockchain?</h3>
          <p>
            Blockchain has been hitting the world of technology in recent years as of it huge potential of a secure way
            for storing and transferring data on the internet. It provides a decentralized, transparent method to control information 
            and data. To put it simple, a blockchain is a shared database of which all the computers in the same network knows what
            data was inserted or action has been performed on that database. This prevent the risk of needing just a single central
            authorize to control the data, which would potentially create vulnerabilities for the whole network.
          </p>
          <p>
            So how does it work, and what makes it more secure than normal system? As the name itself, data in a blockchain system
            is divided into blocks that are chained to each other. Each block in the chain contains a unique hash to encode and decode 
            the data, the hash of the previous block, a timestamp of when the block is created, and a record of transactions that has
            happened in that block. Think of it as almost the same as a linked list, each node have the key of the next node, but in
            this case, the key of the previous node. Why do we have to do this? As a chain, we don't want it to have any vulnerabilities
            in between the block, so doing this create a consistent of the system: Once a block has been added to the chain, it cannot be
            altered or deleted, providing a hash information of the previous block, making it strongly linked with each other.

            <h3>What is Solidity?</h3>
            <p>
              Solidity is an object-oriented based, high-level programming language that is created by Gavin Wood - An English 
              software developer. As I was mentioned above, it is used to design "Smart Contracts"
